Based on the data retrieved from the USGS earthquake API, I've compiled comprehensive visualizations of earthquake activity in the United States over the past year. Let me explain the findings:

## Earthquake Data Analysis for the United States (April 2024 - April 2025)

### Geographic Distribution of Earthquakes

The map of earthquake locations clearly shows that seismic activity in the United States is concentrated in several key regions:

1. **West Coast**: The highest concentration of earthquakes occurs along the Pacific coast, particularly in California, Oregon, and Washington, which align with the San Andreas Fault system and Cascadia Subduction Zone.

2. **Alaska**: There is significant earthquake activity in Alaska, which sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire.

3. **Hawaii**: Another notable cluster of seismic events appears in Hawaii due to volcanic activity.

4. **Central United States**: Some activity is visible in states like Oklahoma and Texas, which may be related to both natural seismicity and induced earthquakes from activities like wastewater disposal from oil and gas operations.

### Magnitude Distribution

The histogram of earthquake magnitudes reveals important patterns:

- The vast majority of earthquakes recorded were of lower magnitude (between 1.0 and 3.0).
- There is a significant drop-off in frequency as magnitude increases.
- Very few high-magnitude earthquakes (5.0+) occurred during the year.
- The distribution follows the expected logarithmic pattern, consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter law which states that earthquake frequency decreases exponentially with increasing magnitude.

### Temporal Patterns

The time series analysis shows:

- Earthquake activity fluctuates throughout the year with some periods showing higher frequency than others.
- There appear to be several spikes in activity, which could represent aftershock sequences following larger events.
- The data doesn't show a strong seasonal pattern, suggesting that earthquake occurrence is not heavily influenced by seasonal factors.

### Monthly Earthquake Counts

The monthly earthquake counts provide additional insights:

- Some months experienced significantly higher earthquake activity than others.
- The month-to-month variation shows periods of increased seismic activity followed by relatively quieter periods.
- This pattern may reflect typical earthquake behavior, with mainshocks followed by aftershock sequences that gradually diminish over time.

### Magnitude Heatmap

The heatmap visualization provides a clear picture of where high-magnitude earthquakes are concentrated:

- The western United States, particularly California, shows the highest concentration of earthquake activity.
- Alaska also demonstrates significant activity, with some higher magnitude events.
- The central and eastern regions of the country show much less seismic activity overall.
- Clusters of higher magnitude events (indicated by warmer colors) are visible in specific regions along the West Coast and Alaska.

## Summary

The analysis reveals that earthquake activity in the United States over the past year follows expected patterns in terms of geographic distribution, with most activity concentrated along the West Coast and Alaska. The majority of earthquakes were of lower magnitude, with very few high-magnitude events recorded. Temporal patterns show fluctuations throughout the year without strong seasonal trends, and the monthly analysis highlights periods of increased activity that likely represent aftershock sequences following larger events.

This compilation of data provides valuable insights into seismic patterns across the United States and can help inform emergency preparedness efforts, building code development, and further scientific research into earthquake prediction and mitigation.
